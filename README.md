# Echo VR SUHTM 


**Currently the servers are simple websocket servers and the servers send nothing back to echo causing a login loop for now**

these servers are written in Deno (https://deno.land)

## how to run

in terminal once you installed deno do this 

deno run -A poweron.ts

done right and this should pop up in terminal

Listening on http://localhost:6780/
Listening on http://localhost:6784/
Listening on http://localhost:6781/

## pointing Echo VR to these servers
look in _local there should be a config.json then
put the config.json file in _local in the games files location 

any problems running the servers feel free to dm me on discord @kakemono#0
